## 5. File ‘approximation_1’
**Goal:** validate several approximation functions according to the received data.
<br>
<br>

## 6. File ‘approximation_2’
**Goal:** 1) with symPy find appropriate polinoms for data sets and then explore each result; 2) get MSE value less then given one.
<br>
<br>

## 7. File ‘polynomial_interpolation’
**Goal:** find polynomials which describe the following data sets using SymPy. Then study every polynomial: even/odd, zeroes, constancy intervals. Build the graphs. Show all the zeroes on the graphs.
